## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** – these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!

- 🏗️ **Activities** – these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** – Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE9 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE9/tree/main/00_Initial_Setup)!


#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

3. Prompt: What can I cook with chicken, garlic, butter, honey and soy sauce in fridge?
   - Result: You have some great ingredients on hand! You can make a delicious honey garlic chicken. Here’s a simple recipe you can follow:

        ### Honey Garlic Chicken

        **Ingredients:**
        - Chicken (breast or thighs)
        - Garlic (minced)
        - Butter
        - Honey
        - Soy sauce
        - Optional: salt, pepper, and any vegetables you may have.

        **Instructions:**

        1. **Prepare the Chicken:**
        - If using chicken breasts, you might want to cut them into smaller pieces or tenderize them for quicker cooking.

        2. **Make the Sauce:**
        - In a bowl, mix together a few tablespoons of soy sauce, a couple of tablespoons of honey, and minced garlic (about 2-4 cloves, depending on your preference). Adjust the honey and soy sauce ratio to taste.

        3. **Cook the Chicken:**
        - Heat a skillet over medium heat and add a tablespoon of butter.
        - Once the butter is melted and sizzling, add the chicken pieces. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
        - Cook the chicken until it is golden brown on one side (about 5-7 minutes), then flip and cook for another few minutes until cooked through.

        4. **Add the Sauce:**
        - Pour the honey garlic sauce over the chicken in the skillet.
        - Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for a few minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken and glaze the chicken, stirring occasionally to coat the chicken evenly.

        5. **Serve:**
        - Once the chicken is coated in the sauce and cooked through, remove from heat.
        - You can serve it over rice, noodles, or with steamed vegetables.

        ### Optional Add-ins:
        If you have any vegetables like bell peppers, broccoli, or snap peas, you can sauté them in the same pan before adding the chicken to make it a complete meal.

        Enjoy your flavorful dish! Let me know if you need any more help or tips.

#### ❓Question #2:

#### 🏗️ Activity #3: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Requires Additional Capabilities)

Now test your assistant with questions that would require capabilities beyond basic chat, such as access to external tools, APIs, or real-time data. Try prompts like:

- "What does my schedule look like tomorrow?"
- "What time should I leave for the airport?"

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: What does my schedule look like tomorrow?
   - Result: I don’t have access to your personal schedule or calendar. However, I can help you outline a plan for tomorrow or assist you in prioritizing tasks if you share what you need to accomplish. Would you like to do that?
2. Prompt: What time should I leave for the airport?
   - Result: To determine what time you should leave for the airport, consider the following factors:

        1. **Flight Departure Time:** Find out when your flight is scheduled to depart.
        
        2. **Airport Arrival Time:** Most airlines recommend arriving at the airport at least 2 to 3 hours before an international flight and 1.5 to 2 hours before a domestic flight.

        3. **Travel Time to the Airport:** Think about how long it typically takes to get to the airport, factoring in current traffic conditions, time of day, and whether you’re using public transportation or driving.

        4. **Additional Time for Security/Check-in:** Consider any extra time you might need for security checks, baggage drop, or any possible delays.

        Once you have this information, add up the times and set a departure time that allows you to factor in any unexpected delays. 

        If you can share specific details, I can help you calculate a more precise time!

#### ❓Question #3:

What are some limitations of your application?
##### ✅ Answer: The assistant is limited in accessing real-time, personal, or external data. For example, it cannot view my calendar, flight details, or current traffic conditions directly. While it can provide guidance and suggestions for planning based on information I provide, it cannot perform tasks that require live data or interaction with external tools, personal accounts, etc.
